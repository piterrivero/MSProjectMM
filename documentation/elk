1.- In our microservices we have to add on the application.yml the log entry indicating the same log file  for all of them

logging:
  file: C:/Users/esu99pitrive/Desktop/developer/msproject/logstash/elk-stack.log

2.- Create the folder and the empty file on the indicated path

3.- Add the docker images to the docker-compose. See the file docker-compose-msproject.yml

4.- On the Logstash configuration take care with this part:0

volumes:
    - ./logstash/:/logstash_dir
    command: logstash -f /logstash_dir/logstash.conf
    
On the same lavel where is the docker-compose will be created a logstash folder,
inside this folder we have to create the file logstash.conf with the next code:

input {
	file {
		path => "C:/Users/esu99pitrive/Desktop/developer/msproject/logstash/elk-stack.log"
		start_position => "beginning"
	}
}

output {
	elasticsearch {
		host => ["localhost:9200"]
		index => "msproject-%{+yyyy.MM.dd}"
	}
}

5.- The folder and the content of the logstash folder will be mapped inside our container on the path logstash_dir
so to see if the file exist and the content is right we have to go inside the container:

docker exec -it logstash bash

and go to: 

"cd ../../../logstash_dir"

6.- After we have up all the containers: kibana, logstash and elasticsearch we have to the elastic
dashboard, go to the next link:

http://localhost:5601/app/home

7.- Now we have to create our own index in order to map the logs of our application

Go to the Dev Tool Section and add the next entries:

PUT /msproject
{
  "settings" : {
    "index" : {
      "number_of_shards" : 3,
      "number_of_replicas" : 2
    }
  }
}


POST /msproject/default/
{
  "name" : "event processing",
  "developer" : {
    "firstName" : "Piter",
    "lastName" : "Rivero"
  }
}
